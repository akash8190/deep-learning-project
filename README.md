## Artificial neural network implementation using churn_modeling

In this project we simply analyze churn modeling using artificial neural network with the help of keras library, this is a simple deep learning project in which we build simple neural network and try to predict the output of bank customer data

## Technlogy use
python(version 3.7)
keras 
tensorflow

## deep learning 

Deep Learning is the most exciting and powerful branch of Machine Learning. It's a technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.
In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.


## Artificial neural network

Artificial Neural Networks or ANN is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way the biological nervous system such as brain process information. It is composed of large number of highly interconnected processing elements(neurons) working in unison to solve a specific problem.”
